# WhatsApp Business CRM Chatbot (Flask + Gemini)

This is a multilingual business chatbot that integrates with **WhatsApp Cloud API** and uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** for intent detection and message generation. It detects leads, stores them in a PostgreSQL database, and only responds to business-related topics.

For this project to work, you have to register Meta Developer Account, if you don't have it already, and then create an app in **https://developers.facebook.com/apps/**.

Set up WhatsApp API and webhook in app settings.

- Do not forget to implement your system prompt in **app/gemini_service.py**. 

### 4. Initialize the database

Ensure your PostgreSQL is connected, and then:

flask db upgrade
```

### 5. Expose webhook and run the app

I used ngrok, but you can use your own domain.
Then you can just run the server on the same port as you are running the webhook.
